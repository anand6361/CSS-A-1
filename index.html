    <h2>What is CSS?</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheet.</li>
        <li>CSS describes how HTML, elements are to be displayed on screen,paper,or in othe media.</li>
        <li><span class="list1">CSS is not necessary</span> <span class="list2">CSS saves a lot of work.</span>It can contol the layout of multiple web pages all at once.
        </li>
        <li><span class="list3">External stylesheet are stored in CSS files.</span></li>
    </ol>
    <h2>CSS can be added to HTML documents in 3 ways:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Inline- by using the style attribute inside HTML elements</li>
        <li>Internal- by using a style element in the head section</li>
        <li>External- by using a link element to link to an external CSS file.</li>
        <li>The most common way to add CSS is to keep the styles in external CSS files. However, <span class="list4">in this tutorial we will use inline and internal styles,</span> because this is easier to demonstrate,and easier for you to try it
        yourself.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>When comparing CSS class vs ID,the differnce is that CSS class applies a style to multiple elements.ID, on the other hand,applies a style to one unique element.ID is also special in that you can use a special URL.to link directly to an element and it's used by JavaSript.</p>
    <p>In CSS, selectors are used to target a specific element or range of elements on a webpage.Once an element has been targeted, a style or set of styles can be applied to the elements.</p>
    <p>There is a wide range of selectors available.Two of the most commonly used are class and ID.Both are used to target elements to which a style should be applied.</p>
